# AGENTS.md - Coding Agent Guidelines for [PROJECT_NAME]

This file is an index. Load only the specific doc(s) relevant to your task to minimize context usage.

## Before Starting Any Task

**1. Estimate the size** of the change using t-shirt sizing:

| Size | Lines of change | Action |
|------|----------------|--------|
| XS | < 50 | Proceed directly |
| S | 50–250 | Proceed directly |
| M | 250–750 | Proceed directly |
| L | 750–2,500 | Proceed directly |
| XL | > 2,500 | **Stop — split into increments first** |

If the estimate is XL, create a work file in `work/` that decomposes the task into L-or-smaller increments, then work through them one PR at a time. See [agents/incremental-work.md](agents/incremental-work.md) for the work file format.

**2. Check `work/`** for an active task file on the same topic before starting new work. If one exists, resume from the first unchecked task. **Never pick up a work file unless the user explicitly asks you to work on that topic.**

**3. Git commits** — Never auto-commit changes. Always ask the user before committing. Before committing, re-read this file (AGENTS.md) to load any required context documents for the changes being committed.

**4. Git push** — Always push using the HTTPS URL directly: `git push https://github.com/[ORG]/[REPO].git`

<!-- Uncomment and populate when you have active work files:
| File | Description |
|---|---|
| [work/example-task.md](work/example-task.md) | Description of the task |

## Generic Docs

These docs apply to all projects using this agent structure:

| Doc | When to load |
|---|---|
| [agents/bug-fixes.md](agents/bug-fixes.md) | Resolving bugs (includes regression test requirement) |
| [agents/coverage.md](agents/coverage.md) | Any edit that adds or modifies functions (100% function coverage required) |
| [agents/incremental-work.md](agents/incremental-work.md) | Managing a work file for a multi-increment task |

### Language-Specific Docs

Load the appropriate language-specific doc alongside the generic one:

| Doc | When to load |
|---|---|
| [agents/rust/coverage.md](agents/rust/coverage.md) | Rust projects: coverage tooling commands |
| [agents/typescript/coverage.md](agents/typescript/coverage.md) | TypeScript projects: coverage tooling commands |

## Project-Specific Docs

<!-- Add your project-specific docs here. Examples:

| Doc | When to load |
|---|---|
| [agents/project-overview.md](agents/project-overview.md) | Understanding project structure, modules, feature flags |
| [agents/build-and-test.md](agents/build-and-test.md) | Running builds, tests, linting, or formatting |
| [agents/code-style.md](agents/code-style.md) | Writing or reviewing code (imports, errors, naming, etc.) |
